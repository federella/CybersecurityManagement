#CybersecurityManagement

1. Read the information security breach “Anthem:
How does a break like this happen?” described in the
following web site: http://www.csoonline.com/article/2881532/business-continuity/anthem-how-does-a-
breach-like-this-happen.html?page=2

2. Identify which control weaknesses – in your opinion - may have exposed the Organization to the
vulnerabilities exploited in the attack described in the case study;
3. Discuss which information security ethical principles would apply to the control weaknesses identified in
the previous step 2 [GUIDANCE: Please reference the set of slides N.3 on “Ethics”];
4. Analyze the whole life-cycle of the attack/vulnerability scenario under exam and the control weaknesses
identified in the previous step 2.
5. Referencing the ISO27001/2 standard or any other information security standard/best
practices/frameworks of your choice (i.e., TOP 20 Critical Controls; NIST Series 800; etc.), describe at
least five (5) controls that would have mitigated the weaknesses identified, how and why; and
6. Conclude your analysis with summary observations about any potential limitations presented by the
referenced information security standard/best practices/frameworks.
